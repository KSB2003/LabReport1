You can use this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the appropriate version of visual studio code depending on the number of bits and the operating system that you are using.

Step 2: After installing you can access the zip file from your downloads and open it. This will look as follows (on MacOS):

Step 2: Once you have done this you should be able to see your unique user code. It would be "cs15l22" followed by three letters that are unique to your account.

Step 3: Open up a terminal and type the following command in order to establish remote control. Also note that the hostname would follow the user and it would be '@ieng6.ucsd.edu'.
`$ ssh user@hostname`.
